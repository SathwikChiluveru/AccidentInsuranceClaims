# Accident Insurance Claim Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract implementation for managing accident insurance claims. The smart contract allows policyholders to file claims, and insurers to approve or reject those claims. It provides a transparent and decentralized solution for handling accident insurance claims on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Details

The repository consists of two Solidity contracts:

1. `AccidentInsuranceClaim.sol`: This contract represents an accident insurance claim. It allows policyholders to file claims and stores the relevant information such as the insurer, policyholder, claim amount, and claim status.

2. `AccidentInsuranceClaimHandler.sol`: This contract serves as a handler for the accident insurance claim process. It inherits the functionality from `AccidentInsuranceClaim.sol` and provides additional functions for insurers to approve or reject claims.

## Getting Started

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Install a suitable Ethereum development environment such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

2. Compile the smart contracts using the Solidity compiler (solc) of your development environment.

3. Deploy the contracts to an Ethereum testnet or a local development blockchain.

4. Interact with the deployed contracts using their respective contract addresses.

## Usage

Here's a brief overview of the contract functionalities:

1. Policyholders can file claims by calling the `fileClaim()` function of the `AccidentInsuranceClaim` contract.

2. Insurers can approve or reject filed claims by calling the `approveClaim()` or `rejectClaim()` functions of the `AccidentInsuranceClaimHandler` contract, respectively.

3. The state variables and events in the contracts provide transparency and record the relevant information for each claim.

Please refer to the contract source code for detailed information on the functions and variables.
